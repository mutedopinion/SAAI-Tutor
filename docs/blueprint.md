# **App Name**: SAAI Tutor

## Core Features:

- Socratic Teaching Engine: Offers personalized guidance with progressive hints, unlocking full answers only after sufficient student attempts, adapting to new topics, and providing encouragement.
- Model Hub Integration: Enables users to browse, install, and manage tiny LLMs from Hugging Face, with compatibility checks and seamless activation.
- Wikipedia Knowledge Connector Tool: Fetches real-time summaries from Wikipedia and suggests Wikimedia diagrams inline with AI explanations, enhancing understanding.
- Visual Aid Generation: Generates text mindmaps or Mermaid diagrams using the LLM to present information visually.
- File Upload & Parsing: Allows users to upload images, PDFs, and TXT files, with offline OCR and PDF parsing, chunking long texts and creating summaries for exceeding context window limits.
- Progress Tracker: Displays metrics such as topics covered, attempts, hint depth, and study time through charts, providing local-only data with opt-in analytics.
- Smart Context Insertion: Offers 'insert into input' function so the user can copy any passage into the input prompt, and attaches context metadata for the LLM to continue coherently from that point without restarting the whole conversation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) for a focused, intellectual feel.
- Background color: Very light Indigo (#E8EAF6), nearly white, for a calm and uncluttered learning environment.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00BCD4) for interactive elements and highlights, promoting clarity and engagement.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif font, for readability and an intellectual feel.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use simple, clear icons related to educational topics.  Icons should match the stroke weight of the selected fonts.
- Subtle transitions and animations for feedback and progress indication.
